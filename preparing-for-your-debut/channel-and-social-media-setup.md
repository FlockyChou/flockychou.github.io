## Social Media Setup

As stated previously, while it may not always be possible to get your preferred username/handle on every social media platform, it would be ideal if you could at least have most of them be consistent to prevent impostors.

### Social Media Tags

You may want to create some tags for your community to share fanart and have discussions regarding your streams. A good rule of thumb is to always search these tags first to ensure no one is currently using them already. If there posts under a tag, either find another one or, in the event there are very few and old posts, reach out to the "owner" of the tag to see if they would be willing to allow you to use it.
