## Choosing What Type of Model

### PNGTubers

PNGTubers typically have a low bar of entry to get started. However, some modern PNGTubers can be as expressive as some Live2D models.

At its most basic, a PNGTuber model can be free or cheap illustration of your character that you simply have on your screen as you stream. At its most complex, it can be made of multiple layers, expressions, and move similarly to a Live2D model.

These are recommended for people just getting into content creation and are unsure if they want to stick with it long-term due to their low cost and commitment.

### Live2D Models
Live2D models are what many consider the "standard" VTuber model.

They often have a high bar of entry and are expensive ($500 - $2,000+ USD) due to the amount of work required to rig a Live2D model. 

These are not recommended for beginners due to their high cost and, at times, high computer hardware requirements to run VTubing software, a game, and stream at the same time.

### 3D Models

Similarly to PNGTubers, 3D models can have a low bar of entry to get started.

They can range from head tracking, to hand tracking, to full motion capture. However, what they are capable of is dependent on often-pricey additional hardware.

These are recommended for beginners due to their ease to create without any art experience; however, even moreso than Live2D models, you may require a high-spec computer to run VTubing software, a game, and stream at the same time.
