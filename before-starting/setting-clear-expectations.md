The thing I see the most among people who want to get into streaming is wanting to get paid for just playing games and then quickly getting disappointed by their lack of growth. What many people seem to forget is that, first and foremost, **streamers are entertainers and entertaining is not easy**.

## Things to Consider Before Starting

The video above by Squiiji does a real good job highlighting a lot of time and money sinks that most people don't consider when first trying to get into VTubing or content creation in general. I think a lot of very important things are covered in this video, including:

* Consistency
* Being Entertaining
* Taking Things Seriously
* Self-reflection
* Computer Hardware -- Covered Later
* Investing in Upgrades -- Covered Later

## How to Be Entertaining When No One is Watching

As highlighted in the video above by Zekos, one of the most important things you need to learn how to do is being entertaining when no one is watching. If you are actively watching your view count and only entertaining when you see that someone is watching, chances are it's too late and they may have already left. Your question to yourself should be "At any given time, if someone clicked into my stream, would they have a reason to continue watching or would they click away?" Think about your own experiences clicking into a stream or video and closing it out because it was either boring, too busy, too loud, etc. and use those to gauge your own content.

## How to Approach Content Creation (in General)

{% include youtube.html id='1yFG--iv5fQ' %}

While not explicitly related to VTubing, Coffeezilla put out a video talking about his 10 years of content creation on YouTube. In it, he highlights a number of lessons he learned during this time making content that I feel is very relevant to people looking into getting into content creation today.

## Takeaways

The most relevant takeaways for me are:
* **Focus on the Long-term** - Wanting to get into content creation with the sole goal of making money will show in your work. Getting paid to do what you love would be great but it should not be the immediate goal.
* **Things Take Time** - Not everyone is able to be successful right off the bat. Expect to fail a lot. It's important to focus on knowing what kind of content you want to create and course-correcting, when needed, to better showcase your strengths.
* **It's More than Luck...** - Not everyone is going to go viral. In fact, having one "successful" video go viral does not necessarily turn into long-term success. Focus on honing your craft and learning from your mistakes in order to make better content than trying to game "the algorithm".
* **...But Luck is Still a Factor** - Between "the algorithm" and real-life factors, luck still plays a role in all of it. It's a matter of what you're able to do with that luck that determines your success.
