The thing I see the most among people who want to get into streaming is wanting to get paid for just playing games and then quickly getting disappointed by their lack of growth. What many people seem to forget is that, first and foremost, **streamers are entertainers and entertaining is not easy**.

## Things to Consider Before Starting

{% include youtube.html id='EmiFhbz2e2k' %}

The video above by Squiiji does a real good job highlighting a lot of time and money sinks that most people don't consider when first trying to get into VTubing or content creation in general. I think a lot of very important things are covered in this video, including:

* **Consistency is Key** - While consistency is a key factor the algorithm looks for, creating content consistently also helps build your audience by letting them know when you're streaming.
* **You Need to Be a Jack of All Trades** - Between creating and editing content, posting on multiple social media platforms, promoting and marketing yourself, and engaging with your audience, being a VTuber requires a wide set of skills.
* **You Need to Be Entertaining** - What makes you stand out from the competition? Are you a really skilled gamer? Are you really knowledgable about a certain subject? Are you a good teacher?
  * More information on this is detailed in it's own sub-section below.
* **Networking is Important** - Whether it's making friends or collab partners, you **will** need to step out of your comfort zone if you're an introvert.
  * Please note that a friend does not always mean a collab partner and a collab partner doesn't always mean a friend. 
  * Collabs can be strictly business, where both parties benefit from each other where that be being able to play new and different games or gaining access to each other's audience.
  * There is a difference between networking and clout chasing. Reaching out to someone the sole purpose to benefit from their platform, audience reach, and to ride their coattails is a scummy move.
  * More information on this is detailed in [a later section](https://vtubing.info/post-debut/making-friends-and-collabs.html).
* **You Need Drive/Passion** - As I stated above, if your goal is to sit around and play games all day while incidentally streaming it all, you might not get very far. Your interest and passion (or lackthereof) will show in your work and your audience will be able to tell.
    * If you find your growth stagnating, it's important to self-reflect on why you think that is and make changes rather than just blame your model or the algorithm.
* **Models/Assets/Art Can be Expensive** - Think long and hard about your character design because if you change your mind, it may be costly.
  * There is no shame in using a PNGTuber. In fact, there are plenty of PNGTubers that are YouTube or Twitch Partners.
  * Instead of spending money on an expensive model, you can alternatively use that money to take singing lessons, learn how to edit your videos more proficiently, etc.
* **Computer Hardware** - This is covered in [a previous section](https://vtubing.info/before-starting/understanding-your-hardware-limitations.html).
* **Investing in Upgrades** - This is covered in [a later section](https://vtubing.info/post-debut/peripheral-upgrades.html).
* **Prepare for Negative Interactions** - Due to [kayfabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayfabe) and VTubing culture being built upon [idol culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_idol#Criticism), viewers can often forget there is a human being on the other side of the screen. Parasocial behaviors may occur that push your personal boundaries or make you uncomfortable. It's important to set strict guidelines and work to building a safe community for yourself and your viewers from the start.

### How to Be Entertaining When No One is Watching

{% include youtube.html id='uupxfOwyCUk' %}

As highlighted in the video above by Zekos, one of the most important things you need to learn how to do is being entertaining when no one is watching. If you are actively watching your view count and only entertaining when you see that someone is watching, chances are it's too late and they may have already left. Your question to yourself should be "At any given time, if someone clicked into my stream, would they have a reason to continue watching or would they click away?" Think about your own experiences clicking into a stream or video and closing it out because it was either boring, too busy, too loud, etc. and use those to gauge your own content.

## How to Approach Content Creation (in General)

{% include youtube.html id='1yFG--iv5fQ' %}

While not explicitly related to VTubing, Coffeezilla put out a video talking about his 10 years of content creation on YouTube. In it, he highlights a number of lessons he learned during this time making content that I feel is very relevant to people looking into getting into content creation today.

## Takeaways

The most relevant takeaways for me are:
* **Focus on the Long-term** - Wanting to get into content creation with the sole goal of making money will show in your work. Getting paid to do what you love would be great but it should not be the immediate goal.
* **Things Take Time** - Not everyone is able to be successful right off the bat. Expect to fail a lot. It's important to focus on knowing what kind of content you want to create and course-correcting, when needed, to better showcase your strengths.
* **It's More than Luck...** - Not everyone is going to go viral. In fact, having one "successful" video go viral does not necessarily turn into long-term success. Focus on honing your craft and learning from your mistakes in order to make better content than trying to game "the algorithm".
* **...But Luck is Still a Factor** - Between "the algorithm" and real-life factors, luck still plays a role in all of it. It's a matter of what you're able to do with that luck that determines your success.
