Your internet connection will greatly affect the quality of your stream and if you're able to even stream at all. It's important to know that expensive internet doesn't necessarily mean good internet. The speed and quality if your internet service varies greatly [depending on where you live](https://www.speedtest.net/global-index).

## What Internet Speed Do I Need for Streaming?

{ .important }
If you are multiple people living in your household or have multiple devices that are connected to the internet, you may need higher internet speeds/bandwidth.

According to YouTube and Twitch, in order to stream at 1080p at 60fps:

| Platform | Min Bitrate | Max Bitrate | Recommended |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| [YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2853702?hl=en) | 4 Mbps | 10 Mbps | 12 Mbps |
| [Twitch](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/broadcasting-guidelines?language=en_US) | - | - | 6000 kbps or 6 Mbps |

However, **you should have 50% MORE upload speed than your bitrate setting.** For example, if you are doing 6,000 Kbps, you should have 6,000 Kbps + 3,000 Kbps (50% of 6,000) = 9,000 Kbps upload.

That means for YouTube, it is recommended to have 18 Mbps upload, whereas for Twitch, it is recommended to have 9 Mbps upload.

In the United States, the average cost for 25 Mbps internet is $35/mo and 100 Mbps internet is $62/mo. However, that doesn't always mean that's the price you're going to pay.

## How Do I Check My Internet Speed?

The easiest way to check your internet speed is to use [Speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/), [Fast.com](https://fast.com/), or simply [Google "internet speed test"](https://www.google.com/search?q=internet+speed+test).

The most important number here is upload speed, as that is what you will be using to stream.

## Kbps? Mbps? mbps?

Typically, your internet speed is measured in Mbps (megabits per second). This makes calculating speed a bit annoying as 8 megabits = 1 megabyte (MB), which you might recognize as the unit used to display how big a file is on your computer. This is done to make it look like you are getting more than what you're paying for.

This means that, in theory, on a 100 Mbps internet connection, it should take you 0.08 seconds to download a 1 MB file and 80 seconds to download a 1 GB (gigabyte) file. This also means that on a "gigabit connection", it does **not** mean that you can download 1 GB file in a second. Using the conversion we used before, it would take 8 seconds.
