Your internet connection will greatly affect the quality of your stream and if you're able to even stream at all.

## What Internet Speed Do I Need for Streaming?

While you may have a decent internet connection for watching YouTube or Netflix, the most important number when it comes to streaming is upload speed. Additionally, if you are multiple people living in your household or have multiple devices that are connected to the internet, you may need higher internet speeds/bandwidth.

Below, you can find the recommended bitrates for multiple platforms. Your internet speed **should have at least 50% MORE upload speed than your bitrate setting.** For example, if you are doing 6,000 Kbps, you should have at least 6,000 Kbps + 3,000 Kbps (50% of 6,000) = 9,000 Kbps upload. 

In order to stream at 1080p at 60fps:

| Platform | Min Bitrate | Max Bitrate | Upload Speed Recommendation |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| [YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2853702?hl=en) | 4 Mbps | 12 Mbps | 6-18 Mbps |
| [Twitch](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/broadcasting-guidelines?language=en_US) | 6,000 kbps or 6 Mbps | - | 9 Mbps |
| [Facebook Live]() | 4,500 kbps or 4.5 Mbps | 9,000 kbps or 9 Mbps| 7-14 Mbps |

You can calculate your your own custom bitrate using [a bitrate calculator](https://bitratecalc.com/).

> In the United States, [the average cost for 25 Mbps internet is $35/mo and 100 Mbps internet is $62/mo](https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/internet/internet-cost-per-month/). However, that doesn't always mean that's the price you're going to pay.

## Mbps? mbps?

Typically, your internet speed is measured in Mbps (megabits per second). This is different from mbps (megabytes per second), megabytes being commonly known as the unit used to display how big a file is on your phone or computer.

This makes calculating speed a bit annoying as 8 megabits (Mb) = 1 megabyte (MB). Why is it done like this? Probably to make it look like you are getting more than what you're paying for.

However, this means that, in theory, on a 100 Mbps internet connection, it should take you 0.08 seconds to download a 1 MB file and 80 seconds to download a 1 GB (gigabyte) file. This also means that on a "gigabit connection", it does **not** mean that you can download 1 GB file in a second. Using the conversion we used before, it would take 8 seconds.

You can learn more about the difference and calculate download times using [this Omni Calculator for Download Time](https://www.omnicalculator.com/other/download-time).

## How Do I Check My Internet Speed?

The easiest way to check your internet speed is to use [Speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/), [Fast.com](https://fast.com/), or simply [Google "internet speed test"](https://www.google.com/search?q=internet+speed+test).
