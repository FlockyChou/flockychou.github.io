## Summary

{: .warning }
This page contains material that may be disturbing including cyberbullying, sexual harassment, and stalking. Reader discretion is advised.

{: .note }
While parasocial situations and harassment [can occur to male creators and be perpetrated by female fans](https://animecorner.me/vox-akuma-stands-up-against-toxic-fan-behavior-on-stream/), this section will focus more on the harassment of female creators due to [online harassment (especially sexual harassment) disproportionately affecting women](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/03/06/young-women-often-face-sexual-harassment-online-including-on-dating-sites-and-apps/).

I felt like I needed to create this section due to recent graduations that I've seen in both the corporate and indie VTuber space due to unhealthy parasocial relationships by both the viewer base and the VTuber. Since being a content creator is inherently parasocial in nature it is important to set clear boundaries for both yourself and your audience.

## Parasocial Behaviors

### What is Being "Parasocial"?

Being "parasocial" is often used as an umbrella term for unhealthy relationships between an entertainer and their audience. However, like most thing, in reality, there are levels to it and creator/audience relationships are always going to be a little bit parasocial.

According to [this article by Verywell Mind about parasocial relationships](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-parasocial-relationship-5210770), the 2 main stages of parasocial relationships are:
1. **Parasocial Interactions:** When you feel a sense of belonging when actively interacting with someone. When you think about the person after finishing the stream.
2. **Parasocial Attachments:** Having an attachment similar to a real-life relationship. When an person or fictional character becomes a source of comfort.

The descriptions of both of these sound very normal. Wanting your viewers to feel a sense of belonging or safety when watching your streams isn't a bad thing. And as a streamer, remembering information your viewers shared in chat about their personal lives may be something you do because you care about your audience and their wellbeing.

What's important is making sure you are setting clear boundaries between yourself and your audience to ensure this does not get to unhealthy levels.

### What does "Unhealthy" Look Like?

**For viewers:**
* Expecting favors for donations
* Wanting a relationship
* Trying to find out personal information about the streamer
* Stalking

**For Creators:**
* Befriending viewers
* Sending viewers personalized DMs
* Encouraging unhealthy parasocial relationships via:
  * Creating "girlfriend experience" (GFE) or "boyfriend experience" (BFE) content
  * Asking questions such as "What would you do to me if we were alone?"

### Corporate Examples

[This article by LM Marie](https://www.animefeminist.com/parasociality-killed-the-virtual-youtuber-star/) is a bit outdated but does a really good job summarizing unhealthy examples of parasocial attachment targetted towards corporate VTubers, specifically Hololive creators.

## Sexual Harassment

Due to the [kayfabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayfabe) and [idol culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_idol#Criticism), many viewers can forget that there is a real person behind the VTuber. This can easily lead to unwanted sexualization and sexual harassment.

Especially in male-dominated spaces like gaming, please be aware that [simply existing as a woman can lead to sexual harassment and threats](https://x.com/yourfavtess/status/1799395183458406730). The same goes for members of [the LGBTQAI+ community](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/personal-experiences-with-online-harassment/).

To keep yourself and your community safe, it is important to set clear boundaries and ban those who refuse to respect your boundaries and abide by your rules. Additionally, keep in mind that [where you stream can affect the amount and type of harassment you receive](https://vtubing.info/preparing-for-your-debut/channel-and-social-media-setup.html#where-to-stream).

## How do I Set Boundaries?

1. **Set Stream Rules:** Put clear rules in your stream descriptions stating what types of interactions you are not comfortable with.
2. **Shut it Down:** When you see someone being rude or gross in chat, shut it down. This can be a verbal warning with a reminder to read the rules, a chat timeout, or a ban for repeat offenders.
3. **Set Clear Expectations for Mods:** Let your mod team know when you've updated your rules so they can be aware of any changes. If you have been noticing an increase of certain types of behavior, ask that your mods be more alert of those types of behaviors.
