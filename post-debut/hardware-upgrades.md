I would not recommend upgrading or building a computer if you do not know what you are doing. Building a computer can be cheaper than buying a pre-built one but if you are not handling or installing components correctly, you could easily cause irreparable damage to them and be worse off.

If you don't meet the minimum requirements to play the games you want, you have 2 options:

1. Upgrade parts
2. Build or buy a new computer

## Upgrade Parts

If your computer meets most of the minimum requirements for a game but needs an upgrade in only a few departments, you may be able to upgrade it. However, keep in mind that this might be difficult if you have a laptop or an older desktop:
* Laptops are nearly impossible to upgrade and the only components that are easily upgradable are often the hard drive and the RAM.
* Old desktops are held back by their motherboard, which limits what other components are compatible with it. Older component can also be harder to find and you may spend more money on worse hardware simply due to compatibility limitations. While you can upgrade a desktop's motherboard, you would basically be building a computer pretty much from scratch at that point.

## Building a Computer

If you are experienced and looking to build a PC but need suggestions on hardware that fit your budget or help with hardware compatibility, you can check out these Reddit communities:
* [r/BuildAPC](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/) - "A community-driven subreddit dedicated to custom PC assembly. Anyone is welcome to seek the input of our helpful community as they piece together their desktop."
* [r/BuildMeAPC](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildmeapc/) - "If you are new to computer building, and need someone to help you put parts together for your build or even an experienced builder looking to talk tech you are in the right place!"

## Buying a Computer

If you are looking to buy a pre-built computer, a computer that I’ve seen recommended at a price point that checks all these boxes is the [NZXT “Player: One” at $799 (before taxes)](https://nzxt.com/product/player-one). While this isn’t an endorsement for this product or company, you can use this as a benchmark in computer specs and price when shopping for other pre-built computers.

However, before pulling the trigger on a new computer, there are some things to take into account for desktops vs laptops:

### Desktop

| Pros  | Cons |
| ----- | ---- |
| Usually cheaper than a comparable laptop | Hidden cost of monitor, keyboard, mouse, webcam, and microphone |
| Upgradable but only a pro if you intend on doing so | |

### Laptop

| Pros  | Cons |
| ----- | ---- |
| Have a monitor, keyboard, and touchpad built-in. Often times have webcam and microphone built-in, although you may want to still upgrade these ASAP. | Usually cost more than a comparable desktop |
| | Less upgradable (often only RAM and hard drive) |
| | A desktop CPU and GPU and not the same as a laptop CPU and GPU. Laptop hardware is often less beefy than their desktop counterparts, despite having the same or similar names.
