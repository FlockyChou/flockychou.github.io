## Making Friends

In the Geega clip above by Cheese Sculptor, Geega talks over some of the troubles she faced making friends when starting out and what she ended up learning.

The key takeaways are:
1. **Networking is Important** - Just like real, networking is important to expand your friend circle. Finding a friend and meeting their friends allows you to find like-minded people.
1. **Be Brave** - Be the one to break the ice. People may be hesitant to reach out. Maybe some people have been meaning to reach out to you but haven't mustered up the courage.
1. **Be Yourself** - You should not be reaching out to people for the sole purpose of business; people will be skeptical of you.
1. **Be a Part of the Community** - Ideally, you should be an active member of someone's community before reaching out to them.

## Collabs

As previously featured, [What you need to know as a Vtuber (timestamp relevant)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uupxfOwyCUk&t=365s) by Zekos has a section covering collab etiquette and how to plan one.

### Collab Software

Most VTubers use a PNGTuber for collabs in order to both limit hardware usage and make it easier for their collab partners to show them on screen. In order to do this, you can follow the video above by Ninja-Dee to use [Reactive by Fugi](https://reactive.fugi.tech/). This video may be a bit outdated but I haven't been able to find an updated guide that was easy to follow.
