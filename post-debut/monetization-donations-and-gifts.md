## Monetization

Making partner is first on the list not because it is the easiest to do, but instead, because it is something you need to work towards. This can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months to even a few years.

| Platform | Title | Min Followers | Min Stream Hours | Min Watch Hours | Min Average Viewers | Other Reqs |
| -------- | ----- | ------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------- | ---------- |
| YouTube | [Partner](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72851) | 1,000 subscribers | - | 4,000 in the last year | or 10mil Shorts views in the last 90 days | - |
| YouTube | [Partner (Expanded)](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/13429240) | 500 subscribers | - | 3,000 in the last year | or 3mil Shorts views in the last 90 days | 3 public uploads in the last 90 days |
| Twitch | [Affiliate](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/joining-the-affiliate-program) | 50 followers | 8 hrs | - | 3 viewers | Stream on 7 different days
| Twitch | |[Partner](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/achievements#Partner) | 25 hrs | - | 75 viewers | Stream on 12 different days |

As I covered in a [previous section](/preparing-for-your-debut/channel-and-social-media-setup.html), becoming a Twitch Affiliate is a much easier than becoming YouTube Partner, even after they introduced the expanded program that halves the number of minimum subscribers required to qualify.

## Donations
### Setting up a Business PayPal

I would recommend setting up a [PayPal Business account](https://www.paypal.com/us/business/open-business-account). This is because, when using regular "Personal" PayPal account, people who donate to you will be able to see your real name that you have linked to the account. I would also recommend making a brand new account for this, as there is no way to convert a PayPal Business account back into a PayPal Personal account.

However, just setting up a business account isn't enough. There are some additional things you will need to do to ensure your privacy.

First, you need to go to `Home > Sales > Invoices`.

![Home > Sales > Invoices](../assets/images/paypal-sales-invoices.jpg)

From there, you should see a preview of what your current invoice looks like on the right side of your screen. If it shows any identifying information such as your real name, address, phone number, etc., click on the "More actions" button on the top right and click "Edit business information". From there, make sure any personal information is removed or select "Don't show on invoices" if it is a dropdown. Once you are done, scroll down and click "Save", then refresh to page to ensure everything was saved properly.

If you want to be extra safe, you can ask a friend to donate $1 to see what information shows up on their account when viewing the transaction.

### Setting up Donations

For donations, I would highly recommend using something like [Streamlabs donations](https://streamlabs.com/donations) or [StreamElements tips](https://streamelements.com/setips). This is because both have some form of chargeback protection that other services don't provide.

#### Streamlabs Donations
* Summary: You can get chargebacks while using Streamlabs but if you are able to prove they are malicious, Streamlabs will help dispute it for you.

#### StreamElements Tips
* Summary: SteamElements has a list of known bad actors and will prevent them from donating to you. They also have chargeback protection but it is unclear whether or not this is only for SE Pay or applies to PayPal as well. Further research will need to be done.

## Gifts

### Throne

Allows viewers to crowdsource gifts for you, whether they be personal or stuff you need to stream. The benefit it has over an Amazon Wishlist is that multiple people can contribute to a purchase (10 people chip in $10 to buy a $100 microphone) vs Amazon where someone needs to buy the whole product (one person has to pay the whole $100).
