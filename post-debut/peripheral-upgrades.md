The above video compares the Blue Snowball and Blue Yeti audio recording with the Rode NT1, a $300+ microphone in order to give you a view of what each sounds like compared to each other. It highlights that the Blue Snowball and Yeti, although "budget", can still produce good sound quality that can level up your streaming game.

### Budget Pick: Blue Snowball
The Blue Snowball is a good balance between quality and affordability. I've had mine for 5 years and only very recently upgraded to a Blue Yeti.
At time of writing (April 23, 2024), you can get this [new on Amazon for $45.98](https://amzn.to/3w2I6G3) and [renewed for $24.99](https://amzn.to/4dbahmD).

At $25 for a renewed Blue Snowball, I wouldn't even consider looking at cheap no-brand microphones or headsets.

### Upgrade Pick: Blue Yeticaster Pro Broadcast Bundle (Renewed)
If you're have the budget for it, I would recommend getting the [renewed Blue Yeticaster Pro Broadcast Bundle for $84.68](https://amzn.to/4aLL9BD).

It's a real bang for your buck compared to buying each component separately:
1. [Renewed Blue Yeti Microphone for $62.54](https://amzn.to/3QfaviS)
2. [Renewed Blue Compass Microphone Arm for $38.94](https://amzn.to/4aNfWOf)
3. [Renewed Blue Radius III Shockmount for $36.99](https://amzn.to/3vWWrDZ)
4. Total Value: $138.47 pre-tax at time of writing (April 23, 2024)

However, I will caveat that **I've personally had a bad experience with the Blue Compass microphone arm**. In less than a year, mine would sometimes not be able to hold the weight of the Blue Yeti and droop excessively. I don't know if this is a problem with the design of the microphone arm itself or with just the one I received.

If you're looking to get a renewed Blue Yeti and shockmount anyways, it's still cheaper to buy the bundle than each individually. Alternatively, you can get just the renewed Blue Yeti and an off-brand shockmount, you can save ~$10

### Microphone Arm
I would recommend investing in a microphone arm stand if you don't already have one. This will allow for a lot more flexibility on where your microphone is stationed and ensure your voice is being picked up properly without messing with your face tracking.

From my experience, any microphone arm will do so feel free to browse for one that fits your budget and style. The microphone I've been using for 8 years without issues is [this one by Neewer for $14.39](https://amzn.to/4b8Kaep).

## Accessories

### iPhone Users (for Face Tracking)

#### USB Hub / Phone Charger
The [Anker 7-port USB 3.0 hub with a built-in power adapter](https://amzn.to/4aLsyW8) (available for $35.99) is the first USB hub that I found and tested that had a port that both connected to your computer and is powered. That means that this USB hub will allow you to use your iPhone for face tracking without fear of having it run out of battery mid-stream.

### Phone Holders
When using your iPhone for face tracking, it's important to be aware of where your phone needs to be for the most accurate tracking.

#### Phone Holder Stands
If you need something minimal just to hold your phone, you can search for ["adjustable phone stand" on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3wb1FMn) for some cheap options. You can get these for as little as $5-10. Just be sure the one you choose can meet your desired height and aren't too tall to where it's blocking your monitor.

I personally use the [iOttie Easy One Touch phone holder](https://amzn.to/3JTg3w9) (available for $19.95) in my car and it's been able to support multiple different positions and orientations across multiple phones.

#### Phone Holder Arms
If you need something a bit more complex or need something that you can adjust between multiple positions, I would recommend getting an arm.

You can search for ["phone arm" on Amazon](https://amzn.to/4b0z37k) and get something for $10-20. I am personally not too fond of the fully flexible "gooseneck" ones, as while they are extremely customizable, I find them really hard to adjust or get them into the same position after changing them.

The ones I would recommend are a bit more expensive but you can probably find similar products for cheaper since they are both from "no brand" companies. I've used [this one from jusmo for $43.95](https://amzn.to/4b7G8CV) as a top-down camera for some unboxing videos and [this one from FOUTOUKEEP for $35.99](https://amzn.to/4aOBqKK) has been holding up a mini projector above my bed for over a year without any issues.
