> VTubing doesn't have to be expensive. You can start your VTubing journey with a laptop and free software, assets, and games. You just need to get started.

## Mission

{: .note }
This guide is currently extremely WIP as I gather my thoughts and resources.

The reason this guide wasn't titled "VTubing for Free" is because, between needing to have access to a computer and an internet connection, money already needs to be spent. What this guide **will** try to do is provide the cheapest and most straightforward path from knowing absolutely nothing to streaming, regardless of your experience or hardware.

I have personally gone through each recommended website and resource in order to either (1) make sure they are as straightforward as possible and not overwhelming or (2) simplify them so they can be easily understood.
