This section features a lot of my personal opinions on streaming and streaming platforms.

## Channel Setup

### Where to Stream?

While YouTube may seem like the better option due to its larger user base, Twitch has a larger audience base for livestreaming content while YouTube has a larger focus on on-demand videos. Because of this, discoverability is often much easier on Twitch than YouTube, meaning you will often get more viewers and followers simply from streaming on Twitch. Additionally, [Twitch's Affiliate Program](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/joining-the-affiliate-program) has a much lower threshold to qualify than [YouTube's Partner Program](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72851) so it is easier to get monetized.

However, it's not all fun and games over at Twitch. Twitch streams tend to be more rowdy and while that might be seen as a good thing for engaging your audience, it can come with a price. When popular streamer Jerma transitioned from streaming on YouTube to Twitch in 2021, there was [a noticable increase in transphobia and hateful messages](https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/jerma985-speaks-out-over-transphobia-and-lgbt-hate-in-his-twitch-chat-1528557/).

### The Case Against Multistreaming

The video above talks about some of the pros and cons of multistreaming/simulstreaming. The main takeaways is that, as a new streaming, maintaining and growing on 1 platform is hard enough. You should focus on growing you main audience rather than stretching yourself too thin.

And I agree. From personal experience, as a viewer, simulstreams are fun to watch but often only if you're a Twitch user. Viewers on YouTube often feel like an afterthought and it shows not only in the view count but also in the chat. In my journey to find more indie VTubers to watch, I have been in countless streams on YouTube where there is 1 viewer, only to find that there are streaming on Twitch to 50 viewers. Often times, their YouTube livestream chats have only 1 message: "can you see this?"

As someone who watched VTubers almost exclusively on YouTube, my advice is that of the video's: if you are getting 100 viewers on Twitch and 2 viewers on YouTube, focus your efforts on growing on Twitch; you're not really enticing your YouTube viewers to subscribe anyways.

### Thoughts on Kick

I noted some considerations for streaming on Twitch earlier, namely the increased transphobia and hate speech compared to YouTube. However, neither of them compare to Kick.

Kick.com is a platform that not only houses dangerous content and content creators but also seems to encourage it. Kick has exclusivity contracts with large controversial streamers such as the [transphobic Adin Ross](https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/adin-ross-forced-to-apologize-after-transphobic-rant-2102398/) who has [streamed pornography](https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/adin-ross-says-he-streamed-sexual-content-to-flex-he-could-avoid-ban-2081297/), [offered his viewers money to perform acts of violence](https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/adin-ross-under-fire-for-asking-fan-to-slit-brothers-throat-for-money-2076537/), and told other streamers and his viewers to unalive themselves](https://www.dexerto.com/kick/adin-ross-faces-backlash-after-homophobic-rant-against-kick-viewer-2734478/).

Kick also [launched without a "Report" button](https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/kick-finally-adds-report-button-to-channels-as-criticism-over-moderation-continues-2338696/) and only added one because of an infamous stream where [streamer Ice Poseidon filmed an escort using hidden cameras](https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/kick-under-fire-after-creepy-ice-poseidon-stream-leads-to-arrest-2307122/).

Most recently, there has been an increase of dangerous content on the website that even [Adin Ross thinks is going too far](https://www.dexerto.com/kick/adin-ross-warns-people-will-die-if-kick-doesnt-stop-reckless-driving-streams-2673498/). In April 2024, another prolific Kick streamer, N3on, livestreamed himself and a street racer speeding through traffic and causing a hit-and-run, only to receive a 1-day ban.

I would consider you think long and hard about what kind of community you want to foster and whether or not those align with the values of Kick streamers and their viewers.

### Thoughts on Short-form Content

{% include youtube.html id='pPL7nOOI-_s' %}

Unless you're planning on specifically making short-form content on YouTube or TikTok, it seems like most users who find your content through shorts are exclusively interested in shorts. I've seen this phenomenon occur to a number of indie VTubers where their subscription count blew up due to a viral short but did not see significant growth in stream viewership. In the clip above by Leno Vtuber Clips, idol EN VTuber Rin Penrose talks about their experience with this.

## Social Media Setup

As stated previously, while it may not always be possible to get your preferred username/handle on every social media platform, it would be ideal if you could at least have most of them be consistent to prevent impostors.

### Social Media Tags

You may want to create some tags for your community to share fanart and have discussions regarding your streams. A good rule of thumb is to always search these tags first to ensure no one is currently using them already. If there posts under a tag, either find another one or, in the event there are very few and old posts, reach out to the "owner" of the tag to see if they would be willing to allow you to use it.
