While there is nothing wrong with begin a variety streamer, it's important to identify what kind of content you want to focus on the most to set a vibe for your audience and to find your niche.

## What is a Niche?

This very short video by the YouTube Creators channel gives a good explanation, but basically, it is a focus on creating content for a specific type so that your fans know what to expect.

If you've ever heard of the term "comfy gamer", you'll know what I mean. If you haven't, comfy gamers often play games like Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, and other low-stress games. This often creates a community where their audience can come into chat and wind-down and talk about their day, and situation where the streamer can focus more on talking to their fans rather than focus on high-paced gameplay. However, this doesn't mean they can't try new things like playing a horror gameâ€”it just means that their audience expects a certain type of content and to lay back most of the time when watching.

## Be Flexible

Sometimes the things you want to do and the things you are good at are two different things. In a similar vein, the audience you attract may not be the one you originally planned for. It's important to keep and open mind and be flexible in order to capitalize on things that could make you more successful. For example, if you plan on starting off as a live streamer but find that you aren't having fun with it, there is nothing wrong with transitioning to edited content.
