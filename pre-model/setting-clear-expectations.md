The thing I see the most among people who want to get into streaming is wanting to get paid for just playing games and then quickly getting disappointed by their lack of growth. What people seem to forget is that, **first and foremost, streamers are entertainers and entertaining is not easy**.

## How to Be Entertaining When No One is Watching

Your value proposition should be providing a more entertaining experience than your viewer can get watching another streamer or playing the game for themselves. Your question to yourself should be "If I clicked into a stream and someone else was doing what I was doing, would I continue watching or would I click away?" The video above by Zekoz gives some really good advice on how to be engaging when no one is watching and things to keep in mind when starting your streaming career.

## How to Approach Content Creation

{% include youtube.html id='1yFG--iv5fQ' %}

While not explicitly relevant to VTubing, Coffeezilla put out a video talking about his 10 years of content creation on YouTube. In it, he highlights a number of lessons he learned during this time making content that I feel is very relevant to people looking into getting into content creation today.

The most relevant takeaways for me are:
* **Focus on the Long-term** - Wanting to get into content creation with the sole goal of making money will show in your work. Getting paid to do what you love would be great but it should not be the immediate goal.
* **Things Take Time** - Not everyone is able to be successful right off the bat. Expect to fail a lot. It's important to focus on knowing what kind of content you want to create and course-correcting, when needed, to better showcase your strengths.
* **It's More than Luck...** - Not everyone is going to go viral. In fact, having one "successful" video go viral does not necessarily turn into long-term success. Focus on honing your craft and learning from your mistakes in order to make better content than trying to game "the algorithm".
* **...But Luck is Still a Factor** - Between "the algorithm" and real-life factors, luck still plays a role in all of it. It's a matter of what you're able to do with that luck that determines your success.
