While ultimately, you want to your audience to stick around for your content and personality, your character design is your first impression and what helps draw new viewers in.

I think it is very important to have your character match not only your personality but also your content. That doesn't mean your character design needs to be scream "gamer" or "comfy". Instead, I think it's important to consider what others may think your content would revolve around by looks alone and if the subversion of those expectations would drive them away.

*While rebranding is technically easy to do, redebuting as a brand new character is pretty rare from what I've seen (minus when an indie VTuber joins a corporation and vice versa).*

## Collecting Inspirations

To get started, I would recommend putting together a sort of vision board of some sort, collecting design elements you would want your character to have based on other things you've seen. This can be inspirations from other VTubers, anime characters, real life clothing, animals, etc. The video above by Zekoz briefly goes over how the above would look like.

## Putting It All Together

I recommend watching the video above by Squiiji on what makes a character design memorable for some general advice when trying to come up with a design.

**Key Takeaways:**
1. **Color Palette:** If you have a primary color in mind, you can utilize tools like [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/) or [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) (as recommended in the video) to find a color palette.
2. **Silhouette:** Having a strong silhouette will allow people to identify your character more easily.
3. **Complexity & Clarity:** The balance between being detailed enough to be interesting but not so busy that it's distracting.
    1. Will your design hold up if someone is watching on their phone?
    2. Do the "marketable plush" test: Would you be able to chibify your character while still making sure they are recognizable?
4. **Focal Points:** Since VTubers are often seen only from the waist-up, focus your details on those areas.
    1. The face (namely the eyes, eyebrows, and mouth) should be key focal points.
5. **Motifs:** Repeating motifs will allow people to identify you more easily.
    1. How do you take something like an icon, design, or color design and transform it to make it your own and instantly recognizable?

### (Optional) Finding Artist Help

For those less artistically-inclined, you can see if you can find an artist to help you flesh a character out. This will be covered in a later section about obtaining a model.

## (Alternative) Buying/Adopting a Character Design or Using a Pre-made Model

If you want to get started as soon as possible, you can find "adoptable" character designs or pre-made model for sale.

For adoptables, you can find people posting them on Twitter using the following hashtags:
* [https://twitter.com/search?q=%23characterdesign %23adoptables](#characterdesign #adoptables)

For pre-made models, refer to the obtaining a model section.

## Finding a Name

Your VTuber name is also an important part of your identity and something you need to be thoughtful about. A common name can lead to you being buried in the search results; however, a name too complex will have users having trouble finding you as well.

Be sure to search for your name combination on Google, Twitter, YouTube, Twitch, or whatever platform you intend on using to make sure it isn't actively used by someone and that there aren't millions of search results for it already.

For example, using a VTuber name generator, it gave me "SerenityScribe", which brings to mind a chill poetry/writing-themed muse VTuber. However, when I search for "serenity scribe" on Google, I see that it has over 1,000,000 search results and is used by multiple social media accounts and businesses. On YouTube, there aren't as many relevant results but the handle @SerenityScribe has been taken, meaning you would have to use a different one.
