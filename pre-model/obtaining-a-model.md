## Choosing What Type of Model

* **PNGTubers** have a low bar of entry to get started. A PNG model can be free or cheap to obtain and do not require good hardware to start.
* **Live2D models** are what many consider the "standard" VTuber model. They are often expensive ($500 - $2,000+ USD) due to the amount of work required to rig a Live2D model.
* **3D models** are often the most mobile out of all the options. Their ability to move can range from head tracking to hand tracking to full motion capture. These often require expensive additional hardware though.

## Creating Your Own Model
* **PNGTuber** - A PNGTuber can be as simple or complex as you want. It can be anything from an illustration to a doodle from Microsoft Paint to a photo.
* **Live2D** - Making a Live2D model can be fairly difficult and not something I have tried so I do not have any recommendations at this time.
* **3D** - [VRoid Studio](https://vroid.com/en/studio) makes it very easy to create a custom 3D model. They also have a [very easy-to-follow guide](https://vroid.pixiv.help/hc/en-us/articles/4405597663385-Getting-Started-with-VRoid) on their website that walks you through the process.

## Commissioning A Model
If you choose to work with an artist, **always read through the artists post and terms or service carefully** to ensure you know what you are paying for. **It is not the artist's fault if you misunderstood the service they are providing!**

*Additionally, some model riggers offer character designing services so if you're already looking to commission a model, don't be afraid to reach out and see if you can work with someone end-to-end.*

I would recommend taking a look on [VGen for someone who would be able to work with you to create a character](https://vgen.co/search?q=character%20design). The reason is that artists on VGen tend to have updated commission status and clear pricing. While a lot of these can be pricey (avg. $200+), you should be able to find a few in the list that are a bit more budget-friendly. Unfortunately, there is not sorting function for price so you will have to look for yourself.

Another place you can look is [the VTuber Market](https://vtuber.gg/browse?q=character+design). However, from personal experience, I found that a number of posts that show "Open" for commissions end up being closed when reaching out to the original poster. Additionally, a lot of the posts only list Discord as a form of communication.

If you're on a really tight budget, you can [check out Fiverr as well](https://www.fiverr.com/search/gigs?query=character%20design). While I've only had positive experiences using Fiverr, I know this is not the case for everyone. My advice would be to look for artists that have recent commissions and reviews and to stay away from things that seem too good to be true (like a full custom VTuber model for $100). Also be aware that Fiverr offers tiers, so read carefully and make sure the cheapest package has everything you are looking for, or else **you may actually end up paying more** than you would have with other artists.

## (Alternative) Buying/Adopting/Using a F2U Pre-made Model
If you want to get started as soon as possible, you can find pre-made model for sale. Some of them even have customizable components like skin tone, hair, and facial features.

You can find these on places like Twitter and Booth, a marketplace with a large community of artists creating models and assets for VTubers for free. Assets get uploaded under different tags and the site may be hard to navigate with many of the items being in Japanese, but you can use the related tags on each search page to browse around.

The best tags that I've found for free Live2D models were:
* [Free Models (live2d tag)](https://booth.pm/en/items?tags%5B%5D=live2d&max_price=0)
* [Free Models (live2d model tag)](https://booth.pm/en/items?tags%5B%5D=live2d%E3%83%A2%E3%83%87%E3%83%AB&max_price=0)

For adoptables, you can find people posting them on Twitter using the following hashtags:
* [https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pngtuber %23adoptables](#pngtuber #adoptables)
* [https://twitter.com/search?q=%23live2d %23adoptables](#live2d #adoptables)
