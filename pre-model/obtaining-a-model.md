## Choosing What Type of Model

### PNGTubers

PNGTubers typically have a low bar of entry to get started. However, some modern PNGTubers can be as expressive as some Live2D models.

At its most basic, a PNGTuber model can be free or cheap illustration of your character that you simply have on your screen as you stream. At its most complex, it can be made of multiple layers, expressions, and move similarly to a Live2D model.

These are recommended for people just getting into content creation and are unsure if they want to stick with it long-term due to their low cost and commitment.

### Live2D Models
Live2D models are what many consider the "standard" VTuber model.

They often have a high bar of entry and are expensive ($500 - $2,000+ USD) due to the amount of work required to rig a Live2D model. 

These are not recommended for beginners due to their high cost and, at times, high computer hardware requirements to run VTubing software, a game, and stream at the same time.

### 3D Models

Similarly to PNGTubers, 3D models can have a low bar of entry to get started.

They can range from head tracking, to hand tracking, to full motion capture. However, what they are capable of is dependent on often-pricey additional hardware.

These are recommended for beginners due to their ease to create without any art experience; however, even moreso than Live2D models, you may require a high-spec computer to run VTubing software, a game, and stream at the same time.

## Creating Your Own Model

### PNGTubers

A PNGTuber can be as simple or complex as you want. It can be anything from an illustration to a doodle from Microsoft Paint to a photo.

For those of you who find that hard, I would recommend taking a look at artist and PNGTuber tsurudraws' video about her free-to-use Picrew below (and a cheap reactive PNGTuber template they are offering in their shop):

{: .important }
Please note that you do not have the permission to use all Picrews for your PNGTuber! Please check with the Picrew creator before proceeding to use their art.

For more complex PNGTubers for the more artistically-inclined, tsurudraws also has a video showcasing how to create a highly expressive PNGTuber model.

### Live2D Models
Making a Live2D model can be fairly difficult and not something I have tried so I do not have any recommendations at this time.

### 3D Models
[VRoid Studio](https://vroid.com/en/studio) makes it very easy to create a custom 3D model. They also have a [very easy-to-follow guide](https://vroid.pixiv.help/hc/en-us/articles/4405597663385-Getting-Started-with-VRoid) on their website that walks you through the process.

## Commissioning A Model

{: .important }
If you choose to work with an artist, **always read through the artists post and terms or service carefully** to ensure you know what you are paying for. **It is not the artist's fault if you misunderstood the service they are providing!**

{: .note }
Additionally, some model riggers offer character designing services so if you're already looking to commission a model, don't be afraid to reach out and see if you can work with someone end-to-end.

### VGen
I would recommend taking a look on [VGen for someone who would be able to work with you to create a character](https://vgen.co/search?q=character%20design). The reason is that artists on VGen tend to have updated commission status and clear pricing. While a lot of these can be pricey (avg. $200+), you should be able to find a few in the list that are a bit more budget-friendly. Unfortunately, there is not sorting function for price so you will have to look for yourself.

### VTuber Market
Another place you can look is [the VTuber Market](https://vtuber.gg/browse?q=character+design). However, from personal experience, I found that a number of posts that show "Open" for commissions end up being closed when reaching out to the original poster. Additionally, a lot of the posts only list Discord as a form of communication.

### Fiverr
If you're on a really tight budget, you can [check out Fiverr as well](https://www.fiverr.com/search/gigs?query=character%20design). While I've only had positive experiences using Fiverr, I know this is not the case for everyone. My advice would be to look for artists that have recent commissions and reviews and to stay away from things that seem too good to be true (like a full custom VTuber model for $100). Also be aware that Fiverr offers tiers, so read carefully and make sure the cheapest package has everything you are looking for, or else **you may actually end up paying more** than you would have with other artists.

## (Alternative) Buying/Adopting/Using a F2U Pre-made Model
If you want to get started as soon as possible, you can find pre-made model for sale. Some of them even have customizable components like skin tone, hair, and facial features.

You can find these on places like Twitter and Booth, a marketplace with a large community of artists creating models and assets for VTubers for free. 

### Twitter

For Twitter, you can find people posting adoptables using the following hashtags:
* [#pngtuber #adoptables](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pngtuber%20%23adoptables)
* [#live2d #adoptables](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23live2d%20%23adoptables)

You can also seach for terms like ["customizable live2d"](https://twitter.com/search?q=customizable%20live2d). I was able to find [the aforementioned customizable PNGTuber by tsurudraws](https://twitter.com/tsurudraws/status/1778927318930723090) for $10, this really cute and [cheap customizable chibi by miikutea_](https://twitter.com/miikutea_/status/1764085270180446287) for $15 and this [full-sized model also by miikutea_](https://twitter.com/miikutea_/status/1780388342649212971) for $35.

### Booth

For Booth, assets get uploaded under different tags so be sure to and the site may be hard to navigate with many of the items being in Japanese, but you can use the related tags on each search page to browse around.

The best tags that I've found for free Live2D models were:
* [Free Models (live2d tag)](https://booth.pm/en/items?tags%5B%5D=live2d&max_price=0)
* [Free Models (live2d model tag)](https://booth.pm/en/items?tags%5B%5D=live2d%E3%83%A2%E3%83%87%E3%83%AB&max_price=0)
