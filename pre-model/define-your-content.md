While there is nothing wrong with begin a variety streamer, it's important to identify what kind of content you want to focus on the most to set a vibe for your audience and to find your niche.

## What is a Niche?

This very short video by the YouTube Creators channel gives a good explanation, but basically, it is a focus on creating content for a specific type so that your fans know what to expect.

If you've ever heard of the term "comfy gamer", you'll know what I mean. If you haven't, comfy gamers often play games like Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, and other low-stress games. This often creates a community where their audience can come into chat and wind-down and talk about their day, and situation where the streamer can focus more on talking to their fans rather than focus on high-paced gameplay. However, this doesn't mean they can't try new things like playing a horror gameâ€”it just means that their audience expects a certain type of content and to lay back most of the time when watching.
