Free assets doesn't have to mean bad. There's a lot of high-quality free assets out there in the wild. All you need to do is find them. Here are some of the places that I tend to look.

**Please be sure to read each post carefully and credit the artists properly!**

## Twitter
Twitter is a really good place to find free overlays, backgrounds, BGM, and VTube Studio model accessories.

The most popular tags are:
* [#freevtuberasset](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23freevtuberasset)
* [#freevtuberassets](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23freevtuberassets)

I also "like" assets I really like at [@FlockyX](https://twitter.com/FlockyX) and retweet free assets when I remember to log in. **I only retweet 100% free assets; no giveaways and raffles.**

## Booth

As mentioned before, Booth is a marketplace for many things but has a large community of artists creating models and assets for VTubers for free. You can find just about anything here.

Assets get uploaded under different tags and the site may be hard to navigate with many of the items being in Japanese, but you can use the related tags on each search page to browse around.

The best tags that I've found were:
* [Free Assets (virtual youtuber tag)](https://booth.pm/en/items?tags%5B%5D=virtual+youtuber&max_price=0)
* [Free Models (live2d tag)](https://booth.pm/en/items?tags%5B%5D=live2d&max_price=0)
* [Free Models (live2d model tag)](https://booth.pm/en/items?tags%5B%5D=live2d%E3%83%A2%E3%83%87%E3%83%AB&max_price=0)

## VTResources

[VTResources](https://vtresources.carrd.co/) is a huge list of assets and creators. I find it a bit overwhelming but there is a lot of useful information in there.

## Misc.

* [Irasutoya](https://www.irasutoya.com/) is the Japanese clipart site that many members of Hololive and clippers use. Unfortunately, the site is mostly in Japanese but there is an English search.
* [Okumono](https://sozaino.site/) is a free background site that I found recommended on Twitter. Unfortunately, the site is only in Japanese so it may be a bit hard to navigate. [Apparently, no credit is needed to use.](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/1bha1rj/comment/kvhhmgv/)
