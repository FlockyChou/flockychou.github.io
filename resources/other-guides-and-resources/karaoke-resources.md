This section is currently YouTube-focused. Twitch might have different rules and ways to handle copyright but I am not well-versed in them yet.

## Pre-work

### Figuring Out Copyright Stuff

To start off, we need to answer the question of "what is the difference between a copyright claim and a copyright strike?"

* [**Copyright Claims**](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7002106?hl=en) are when YouTube identifies copyrighted material in your video using Content IDs. The best case is that nothing happens or the copyright holder claims the revenue on your video. The worst thing that can happen is the copyright holder can issue a takedown notice for your content. Either way, these copyright claims rarely account for fair use and you can dispute these claims by proving you either have the rights or that your work is transformative.
* [**Copyright Strikes**](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2814000?hl=en) are far more serious and are the ones you definitely do not want. These are manually initiated by the copyright holder and can negatively impact your account greatly.

For further reading, I found [this article on Copyrighted](https://www.copyrighted.com/blog/copyright-claim-vs-strike) extremely helpful.

### Archived vs. Unarchived

You may be wondering why someone would opt to do an unarchived karaoke stream instead of an archived one. Copyrights are one of the key reasons why due to how karaoke streams end up being in a copyright grey area due to song licenses and broadcasting rights.

#### Archived

At least on YouTube, typically Japanese songs won't get you copyright struck. This is, based on my understanding, because [YouTube has an agreement with the Japanese Society for Rights of Authors, Composers, and Publishers (JASRAC)](https://www.jasrac.or.jp/ejhp/release/2020/0430.html) where [YouTube pays for these copyright fees](https://monolith.law/en/internet/twitter-copyright-singing).

To check if a song you want to sing is included in this, you can search the [JASRAC database](https://www.jasrac.or.jp/ejhp/database.html) as suggested by [this Redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/1cvortg/comment/l4uryx0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

#### Unarchived

However, you may have noticed that most unarchived karaoke streams feature Western music. This is because how stringent copyright is in the US for music. You may are insistent on making these archived, you may run into copyright claims and potentially strikes. You may be able to get around this by separating your audio tracks so that your stream so that the background track won't show up on your VOD.

### Choosing Songs

I would recommend finding songs you're comfortable with to start. Ideally, these are songs that aren't too out of your range.

You can always pitch shift but it may not sound the best when doing it through third-party means:
* Browser Pitch Shifter: https://twitter.com/tiuuie/status/1391431054511075330
* Pitch Shift in VLC: https://superuser.com/questions/1157810/can-i-change-the-pitch-using-vlc

### Making Your Setlist

If you know what you're doing, you can start with a high-energy song. However, starting with a lower energy song with less high notes can be a good warm-up for you to get into the groove. It will allow you to give it your all later on and build more hype for the bigger and better songs down the line.

### Shoost

{: .note}
As stated in the previous video, you will need to subscribe to the developer [MuRo's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/MuRo_CG) to obtain access to Shoost. Similar effects have been directly built into [VTube Studio v1.28.0](https://twitter.com/VTubeStudio/status/1737956014186496208). However, Shoost is made by a small developer worth supporting and has a number of additional effects built into it.
