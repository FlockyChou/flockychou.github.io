## Buying/Adopting/Using a F2U Pre-made Model
If you want to get started as soon as possible, you can find pre-made model for sale. Some of them even have customizable components like skin tone, hair, and facial features.

You can find these on places like Twitter and Booth, a marketplace with a large community of artists creating models and assets for VTubers for free.

## Squiiji's Picrew Master List
Artist VTuber Squiiji, whose video was featured in a previous section, created a [master list of F2U (free to use) Picrew PNGTuber generators](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xuLykMNFDOj_7cRN09Suqf0wecZ1VufzN9OEY9PDkzg).

Please note that while these are free to use, **all Picrews used for PNGtuber creation must be credited via a link to the Picrew's artist.**

## Twitter

For Twitter, you can find people posting "adoptables" using the following hashtags:
* [#pngtuber #adoptables](https://x.com/search?q=%23pngtuber%20%23adoptables)
* [#live2d #adoptables](https://x.com/search?q=%23live2d%20%23adoptables)

"Adoptables" are one-of-a-kind VTuber designs that were created by artists that are being sold as-is. These may be simply the design/full art, ready to rig, or fully rigged, so please be aware of what you are paying for.

You can also seach for terms like ["customizable live2d"](https://x.com/search?q=customizable%20live2d). I was able to find this really cute and [cheap customizable chibi by miikutea_](https://x.com/miikutea_/status/1764085270180446287) for $15 and this [full-sized model also by miikutea_](https://x.com/miikutea_/status/1780388342649212971) for $35.

## Booth

For Booth, assets get uploaded under different tags so be sure to and the site may be hard to navigate with many of the items being in Japanese, but you can use the related tags on each search page to browse around.

The best tags that I've found for free Live2D models were:
* [Free Models (live2d tag)](https://booth.pm/en/items?tags%5B%5D=live2d&max_price=0)
* [Free Models (live2d model tag)](https://booth.pm/en/items?tags%5B%5D=live2d%E3%83%A2%E3%83%87%E3%83%AB&max_price=0)
