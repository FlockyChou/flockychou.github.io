## PNGTubers

A PNGTuber can be as simple or complex as you want. It can be anything from an illustration to a doodle from Microsoft Paint to a photo.

For those of you who find that hard, I would recommend taking a look at artist and PNGTuber tsurudraws' video about her free-to-use Picrew below (and a cheap reactive PNGTuber template they are offering in their shop):

{% include youtube.html id='KGehAyRTtTM' %}

{: .important }
Please note that you do not have the permission to use all Picrews for your PNGTuber! Please check with the Picrew creator before proceeding to use their art.

For more complex PNGTubers for the more artistically-inclined, tsurudraws also has a video showcasing how to create a highly expressive PNGTuber model.

## Live2D Models
Making a Live2D model can be fairly difficult and not something I have tried so I do not have any recommendations at this time.

## 3D Models
[VRoid Studio](https://vroid.com/en/studio) makes it very easy to create a custom 3D model. They also have a [very easy-to-follow guide](https://vroid.pixiv.help/hc/en-us/articles/4405597663385-Getting-Started-with-VRoid) on their website that walks you through the process.
