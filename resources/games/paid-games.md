## Humble Bundle

Humble Bundle has 2 main storefronts for deals: bundles and regular deals:
1. [Humble Bundle bundles](https://www.humblebundle.com/games) allow you to "pay what you want" for different tiers of pre-bundled games and you are often able to get a number of very well-received games at a deep discount. These are great to get the most bang for your buck and to quickly add to your game library.
2. [The Humble Bundle store](https://www.humblebundle.com/store) has regular store deals like much other storefronts.

### Steam Game Price Tracking

Have you been waiting for a game to go on sale? The [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/) tracks the lowest price for games available on Steam. This site lets you easily see what the lowest price a game has ever been and how often it's on sale. I would always recommend checking this site before buying a game to see when it may go on sale again. Additionally, they have [a page featuring current deals](https://steamdb.info/sales/) and has options that allow you to filter and sort by discount percent and user rating.

## Deku Deals

[Deku Deals](https://www.dekudeals.com/) functions similar to SteamDB but for console games. Much like SteamDB, they also have [a page featuring current deals](https://www.dekudeals.com/hottest).

### What About CD Key Sites?

{% include youtube.html id='5nBOMSKP7E4' %}

CD Key sites can contain stolen keys or keys bought with stolen credit cards, both of which actively hurt game developers. I would highly discourage using them to obtain keys for indie games. You can find out more about CD Key sites from the video above.
