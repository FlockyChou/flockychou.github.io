Below are a few places you can find overlay, schedules, alerts, and chat widgets.

## Twitter

Twitter is a really good place to find free overlays, backgrounds, BGM, and VTube Studio model accessories.

I've found the most luck under:
* **Overlays**
    * [#freevtuberasset overlay](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23freevtuberasset%20overlay)
    * [#freevtuberassets overlay](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23freevtuberassets%20overlay)
* **Schedules**
    * [#freevtuberasset schedule](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23freevtuberasset%20schedule)
    * [#freevtuberassets schedule](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23freevtuberassets%20schedule)
    * Additionally, I have a few free to use schedules that I've created over on [my Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/flocky_chou/shop).

I also "like" assets I really like at [@FlockyX](https://twitter.com/FlockyX) and retweet free assets when I remember to log in. **I only retweet 100% free assets; no giveaways and raffles.**

## VTResources

[VTResources](https://vtresources.carrd.co/#assets) has a huge list of assets. Simply search "overlay" or "schedule" on the page to find them.
